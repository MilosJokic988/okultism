# 🕯️ Occult Web Project — Digital Grimoire of Shadows

**Enter the forbidden. Explore the unseen. This is not a website. It's a gate.**

## ✨ Overview

Occult Web Project is a dark-themed, immersive React-based website dedicated to the arcane arts, demonology, alchemy, and ancient esoteric knowledge. It serves as a digital grimoire, built to inform, evoke, and unsettle.

Designed with inspiration from forbidden tomes, glitch aesthetics, and mystical symbolism, this project is part of the **Noctis Design** collection.
